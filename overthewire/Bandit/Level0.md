## Solution

I'm using linux, so I open a shell to use ssh.  
`$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
Enter "bandit0" as the password  
use 'ls' to show files in the directory, and I find a file named readme  
`$ cat readme`
I get a string "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1"  
so I get it as password for next level
