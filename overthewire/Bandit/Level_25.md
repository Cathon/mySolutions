## Bandit Level 25 -> Level 26

## Level Goal

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

## Solution

I ssh to logged in bandit26,then see something strange,and logged out automamaticly.
After having a look at the shell for bandit26, I know command `more` is used.
So there is a trick to get the password by using vi.(refering Nikkko)

```
bandit25@melinda:~$ ls
bandit26.sshkey                                                                                   
bandit25@melinda:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost                                     
Could not create directory '/home/bandit25/.ssh'.

Connection to localhost closed.

bandit25@melinda:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
bandit25@melinda:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext 
#!/bin/sh
more ~/text.txt
exit 0

bandit25@melinda:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
Step1   before exec the command above the size of terminal should be small enough(util you can see 5 line)
Step2   ssh to localhost
Step3   type 'v' to enter vi
Step4   type ':r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26' to show the password on screen
Step5   That's all
```

the password is 5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z
